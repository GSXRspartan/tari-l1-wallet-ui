 * `minimumValuePromise` (on the `shield` and `sendPrivately` operation kinds)
 *
 * A public claim, committed into the new output's own range proof, that it is worth **at least**
 * this much. Raw resource units as a decimal string; omitted or `"0"` means no claim, which is the
 * default and the ordinary case.
 *
 * A confidential output normally proves `0 <= v < 2^64`, hiding `v` entirely. With a promise `m`
 * the proof instead attests `m <= v < 2^64`, and `m` is stored in the clear as
 * `UnspentOutput.minimum_value_promise`. That makes the output a self-contained proof of funds:
 *
 * ```js
 * // Prove this wallet can cover 100000, without revealing what it actually holds.
 * const r = await window.tari.requestTransaction({
 *   kind: "shield", resourceAddress, amount: "100000", minimumValuePromise: "100000",
 * });
 * // Share r.substateId. Anyone verifies it with no cooperation from the wallet:
 * const s = await window.tari.getSubstate(r.substateId);
 * // -> read `minimum_value_promise` off the output, and that the substate is still unspent.
 * ```
 *
 * Three properties worth designing around:
 *
 * - **Non-interactive and permanent.** Verification needs no cooperation from the wallet, no
 *   signature and no live session -- just the chain. Equally, the disclosure is permanent and
 *   public: everyone sees it forever, not only whoever the proof was made for.
 * - **It proves one output, not a balance.** "This output is worth >= m", not "this account holds
 *   >= m". To prove total spending power, shield the whole amount into a single output and promise
 *   against that; `tari_getPrivateBalances`' `outputCount` shows how funds are currently split.
 * - **Spending the output destroys the proof.** Correct semantics -- a proof of funds should stop
 *   verifying once the funds move -- but a verifier must re-check that the substate is still
 *   unspent at the moment they care, not merely that it once existed.
 *
 * Must not exceed the output's own `amount`: a range proof asserting "at least m" is impossible for
 * an output actually worth less, and is refused before anything is signed (see `parseOperation`).
