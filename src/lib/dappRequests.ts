/**
 * Transaction requests: the create → user approval → submit flow a dApp uses for anything that
 * spends, mirroring the extension's `tari_createTransactionRequest`/`tari_getTransactionRequest`/
 * `tari_submitTransactionRequest` (and, upstream of that, `tari_ootle_walletd`'s own
 * `transaction_requests`).
 *
 * Why this rather than one blocking call: `create` returns a `requestId` the instant the request
 * exists, without waiting on the human. A dApp that reloads its iframe while the user is reading the
 * approval — or that simply wants to render its own "waiting for approval" UI — can poll by id and
 * pick the flow back up. A single blocking promise loses everything the moment the page reloads,
 * and for a `sendPrivately` that means losing the `recipientCommitment` the recipient needs to ever
 * see their payment.
 *
 * Records live in memory, keyed by id. That is weaker than the extension, which persists them
 * because Chrome tears its service worker down mid-flow — here the wallet is an ordinary page, so a
 * record outlives every dApp-side reload and only dies when the *wallet* is closed, which ends the
 * session anyway. The difference is documented rather than papered over: `tari_getTransactionRequest`
 * on an unknown id after a wallet reload means "gone", not "still pending".
