// Sub-addresses for the L1 wallet.
//
// A sub-address is this wallet's own address with a payment id attached. Crucially it carries the
// *same* view and spend keys — the payment id only rides along in the address's memo field — so a
// payment to a sub-address is recovered by exactly the same scanning that finds a payment to the
// main address. No new key material is derived anywhere, which is what makes it impossible for a
// sub-address to receive funds this wallet cannot spend. (Proven in the wasm crate's
// `tests/sub_addresses.rs`.)
//
// A sending wallet copies the address's payment id into the output's memo — see
// `transaction_service/service.rs`'s "Address contains memo, overriding memo" path — and this
// wallet reads it back off the recovered output, which is what attributes a payment to the
// sub-address it was sent to.
