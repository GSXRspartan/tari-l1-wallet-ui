/**
 * Ownership testing, off the main thread.
 *
 * Deciding whether an output belongs to a wallet costs a Diffie-Hellman and a decrypt attempt, and
 * it has to be paid for *every* output on the chain — the wallet's own are a rounding error in the
 * total. Run inline that work saturates the main thread and the page stops painting mid-scan.
 * Here it is one worker per core instead, each with its own wasm instance and its own copy of the
 * wallet built from the same backup, so the work actually spreads across the machine.
 *
 * The worker only ever answers "is this one ours"; nothing is imported for keeps here. The main
 * thread re-fetches and re-imports the winners itself, which keeps a single authoritative wallet
 * instance owning every output that gets stored.
